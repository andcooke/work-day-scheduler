This was made July 5, 2022.

# DESCRIPTION
This site allows a user to click a text area and type what their goals are for that hour. The site will adjust the background of each hour as the day progresses. Gray represents hours in the past, red for the current hour, and green for upcoming hours.

# USAGE

![screenshot of page](/assets/images/screenshot.png)

The user can click the save button to the right of each row to save the content within the corresponding text area. This allows the user to save the input without having to keep the website open. If the user erases content within a text box and wishes to save, they must again click the save button to confirm any changes made.


# LESSONS LEARNED
This was truly an exercise in learning to navigate through the DOM and learning the use of jQuery, while also implementing some Bootstrap styling. 

# IMPROVEMENTS 
A delete button to the right of the save button would be a nice addition for future work. This would allow the user to delete all or line by line without having to delete the content manually, then press the save button.

Allowing to fill in an expected time-to-complete for each task. As opposed to just starting them at a certain time, you could also write how long you expect them to take.

Allowing for more responsiveness would also be a huge improvement. Currently the page is only usable on a medium, large, and x-large screen.
